# Reward Containers
A generic, type-safe library for Roblox game development, written using roblox-ts, for granting rewards to players through containers.

# Installation
### For roblox-ts
If you already have roblox-ts set up, then just install this package to your project with `npm i @rbxts/reward-containers`

### For Lua / Luau
This is currently not super simple, but this will be addressed in the future.
